# Dijkstra
I. Dijkstra’s algorithm implementation in python.

II. File list: dijkstra.py

III. Command line arguments in order to run the dijkstra implementation:

	./dijkstra.py 

		or 

	python dijkstra.py

IV:  Instructions for building a graph
	
	The program utilizes an adjacency matrix to represent the input graph and an example graph is provided with the implementation in the text file named graph. The graph is similar to the one that is presented below. Each value in the below 5 x 5 Matrix[i][j] represents the presence of absence of an edge between i,j. A value of zero indicates that an edge doesn’t exits. 
	M[i][j] = 0, where i = j. 

	To create a graph for the program:
	1. In the text file titled graph, build a nxn square matrix. See below and in the provided text file for an example matrix.  
	2. The values should be non-negative real numbers.
	3. Matrix[i][j] = 0, where i = j.
	4. Ensure the values are tab delimited.
